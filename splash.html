    <h3 id = "subheading">By Jonathan Harrison Neves</h3>

    <p id = "info">Over the course of many months, our Richmond-based team has poured extensive resources into the research and development of revolutionary intelligent power supplies that will provide a secure source of electricity to the data centers of the future. With the ubiquity and importance of cloud computing, the demand for reliable power supplies that keep data centers running 24/7 is skyrocketing. Our Uninterrupted Power Supplies, equipped with a vast array of thermal and electrical sensors, are able to detect abnormal environmental changes such as voltage/current spikes and electrical grid shutdowns so that they can quickly act as a secondary power source for the load. Learn more about our research, and find out more about how we leverage Silicon Controlled Rectifer switching circuits to achieve this:</p>
